                <p>Custom software development is the designing of software applications for a specific user or group of
                    users within an organization. The benefit to custom software is the simple fact it provides features
                    off-the-shelf software doesn’t. Designing an application with your organization’s needs in
                    consideration
                    implies an increased level of productivity. If you have a software application designed to increase
                    productivity or address an internal need, the cost of it is offset by the promise of increased
                    efficiency.
