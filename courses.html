                <p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform
                    the
                    traffic directing functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to
                    another router through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its
                    destination
                    node.

                    networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to
                    receive, process, and forward data to the destination device.
